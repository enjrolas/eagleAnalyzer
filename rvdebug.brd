# # The rvbroker.brd entry allows inclusion of a special board file containing
# # all network nodes that can/are running RVBROKER. This allows one single
# # file shared by multiple users to easily access simulators, emulators,
# # and EVMs anywhere on the network. This file should be installed in your
# # home directory or <install>/etc, or you may specify the full pathname
# # to a shared location (on the network).

# # chip designers, and custom board designers (or someone who wants to add
# # the information). This allow use of the extended information by board
# # entries of type DERIVED and DATFILE.
